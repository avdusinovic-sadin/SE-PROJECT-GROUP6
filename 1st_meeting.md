## Ideas

We have discussed the following ideas in our team:

1.University Walkthrough game <br>
2.Jeopardy game <br>
3.Bubble BINFO <br>
4.Monopoly <br>

We did some research on our ideas and we don't know yet which idea is the best for the promotion on the OpenDay, but we still have a lot of time to think about that.
