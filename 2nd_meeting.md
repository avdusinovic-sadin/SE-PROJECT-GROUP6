# 2nd Meeting

**New gaming idea**

After receiving feedback for our first presentation, we have decided on another project.
The new idea was also confirmed by Mr. Volker MÃ¼ller and new game is called BUBBLE BINFO.

*Bubble Binfo* 

_x_Gaming description about the new game:

The aim/goal of the game is destroy some bubbles, but you can't destroy any bubble you want. 
Before you click on start, a menu is displayed where you can see exactly which bubbles you are allowed to hit and which you are not. 
The bubbles you are allowed to hit represent a module such as for examople: Calculus and those bubbles are given a special colour so 
that you know that you will receive points for successfully destroying them. 
Normal soap bubbles, e.g. those that are light blue in colour, may not be destroyed, as they give you minus points.
