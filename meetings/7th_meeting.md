# 7th Meeting (last Meeting)

*Still to be implemented/edited for the webgame* 

  - add second semester to the webgame & quiz
  - change the floating of the bubbles for the second semester (to make it more difficult for the user)
  - some debugging for the session part in the game
  - choose better colors for the courses (to have a better difference/contrast)
  - replace the filler text with a original/more corresponding text

*Commercial video(nearly done)* 

  - make some small changes
  - delete some parts of the first version of the commercial video
  - (maybe add the quiz aswell in the video, not only the webgame)

*Explainer video* 

The explainer video will be published after we are done with the code of the webgame & quiz. This video will give you a few impressions 
how we got our game idea , how to program such a game and also how to host such a webgame.
