# 5th Meeting

*Bubble Binfo* 

We had a meeting where we have created together a list and set some priorities for the webgame.
The number 1 means that it's a high priority, the 2 on the other hand is important, but it does not necessarily have to be done immediately. 
The 3 is optional at the moment.

The list that we have defined together as a group:

  - Template for documentation (2)
  - Score +/-1 (1)
  - Web server (1)
  - 0-10 ects ->3questions, 10-20 ects ->2 questions & 20-30 ects ->1 questions (3)
  - Skip or pause button for the intro (2)
  - Confirmation questions for the skip/pause button (2)
  - Improve the design of the webgame (2)
  - Make the bubbles dissappear after the click (1)
