# 3rd Meeting

*Bubble Binfo* 

Preparation for the 2nd Presentation:

We have updated our Trello & Github and created a new powerpoint for our 2nd presentation in this course. (software engineering project)
We haven't started programming the game yet because we are still waiting for a feedback for our game. After the feedback we will slowly but surely start 
with the programming part for the game.
