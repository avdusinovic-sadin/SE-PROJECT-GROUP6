# 4th Meeting

*Bubble Binfo* 

Started with the coding part:

We have now officially started with the coding part of the project. For the first task we need to do is to build a simple website/webgame structure in HTML. 
After this task, we will start to write the script for the bubbles in the game as this is the most difficult part of the game. 
Later on the design of the website will be done and maybe some minor changes to the game idea.

Started with the design for the logo & website:

We will also create our own logo for Bubble Binfo! This is a small part of the project, but it's still important.
Later on we have designed some wireframes for the webgame and you can see those wireframes in the design folder.
